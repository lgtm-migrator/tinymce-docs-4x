Now that you know how to add TinyMCE to your page, and how to use the `inline` mode, it's time to learn how to add multiple editor instances to a single page.

This is, in fact, a common use case, especially when using TinyMCE's `inline` mode. For example, you may wish to break your content into sections (e.g., titles, paragraphs) that the user can edit individually.

[[multiple-editor-instances-sharing-the-same-configuration]]
== Multiple editor instances sharing the same configuration
anchor:multipleeditorinstancessharingthesameconfiguration[historical anchor]

In the following example, the page is broken into two separate editable areas, each sharing a single editor configuration. Each editable `div` is provided the same `class` of 'myeditablediv'. When the user clicks within the content area, TinyMCE is loaded for just that area.

  <script type="text/javascript">
  tinymce.init({
    selector: '.myeditablediv',
    inline: true
  });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Multple editors on a page: Section 1</h1>
  <form method="post">
    <div class="myeditablediv">Click here to edit the first section of content!</div>
  </form>

  <h1>Multple editors on a page: Section 2</h1>
  <form method="post">
      <div class="myeditablediv">Click here to edit the second section of content!</div>
  </form>
</body>
</html>

====
Pro tip: note that the reason the css selector in this example is a `class` is because the `id` must be unique.

[[multiple-editor-instances-each-with-a-unique-configuration]]
== Multiple editor instances, each with a unique configuration
anchor:multipleeditorinstanceseachwithauniqueconfiguration[historical anchor]

In this next example, each editable area is loaded with an instance of TinyMCE with a unique configuration. This is especially helpful when different content areas have different needs. For example, you may want to provide a simple configuration for editing titles and a complete configuration for editing body content. This is accomplished by defining a `tinymce.init` object/method for each desired configuration.
