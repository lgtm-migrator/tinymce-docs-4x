TinyMCE is a powerful and flexible text editor that makes it incredibly easy for people with various levels of technical expertise to create rich content. Tiny Cloud is perfect for anyone who wants an easier installation and upgrade process. This document is the place to start if you are new to TinyMCE and want to get a local editor instance up and running in less than 5 minutes (via our TinyMCE Cloud).

Now, back to getting started with TinyMCE. You'll have a basic local editor instance up and running in the next 3 steps.

[[step-1-include-the-tinymce-script]]
== Step 1: Include the TinyMCE script
anchor:step1includethetinymcescript[historical anchor]

Include this line of code in the `<head>` of your HTML page:

[source,html]
----
<script src='{cdnurl}'></script>
----

TIP: We give you a complete HTML snippet in Step 2.

[[step-2-initialize-tinymce-as-part-of-a-web-form]]
== Step 2: Initialize TinyMCE as part of a web form
anchor:step2initializetinymceaspartofawebform[historical anchor]

With the script included, initialize TinyMCE on any element (or elements) in your web page.

Since TinyMCE lets you identify replaceable elements via a CSS selector, all you need to do is pass an object that contains a `selector` to `tinymce.init()`.

In this example, let's replace `<textarea id='mytextarea'>` with a TinyMCE editor instance by passing the selector `'#mytextarea'` to `tinymce.init()`.

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src='{cdnurl}'></script>
  <script>
  tinymce.init({
    selector: '#mytextarea'
  });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
<h1>TinyMCE Quick Start Guide</h1>
  <form method="post">
    <textarea id="mytextarea">Hello, World!</textarea>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
----

[[step-3-saving-content-with-a-form-post]]
== Step 3: Saving content with a form POST
anchor:step3savingcontentwithaformpost[historical anchor]

When the `<form>` is submitted the TinyMCE editor mimics the behavior of a normal HTML `<textarea>` during the `post`. In your form handler, you can process the content submitted as if it had come from a regular `<textarea>`.

So that's all there is to it!

If you prefer to download TinyMCE and install it locally the link:{baseurl}/general-configuration-guide/advanced-install/#packagemanagerinstalloptions[Advanced Install] page in the link:{baseurl}/general-configuration-guide.html[General Configuration Guide] has instructions. This document also provides information about TinyMCE features such as advanced installation options, working with plugins, learning about content filtering, and spell checking.

You may use TinyMCE Cloud without an API key. However, to avoid the in-editor developer warning or use our premium plugins, sign up for an API key and update the script tag used to load the editor code into your application. Please visit the link:{baseurl}/cloud-deployment-guide.html[Cloud Deployment Guide] to learn more about the plugins and other features of TinyMCE.
