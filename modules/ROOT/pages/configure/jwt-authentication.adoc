[[audience]]
=== Audience

This section is intended to be used by developers with prior knowledge of JSON Web Token (or JWT) in detail, including how they can be used for user authentication and session management in a web application. There will be some coding involved on both the client-side and the server-side to configure JWT as per the instructions in this section.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Some cloud services for TinyMCE require configuring JWT authentication to verify that the end users are allowed to access a particular feature. JWT is a common authorization solution for web services and is documented in more detail at the \https://jwt.io/ website. This section aims to show how to setup JWT authentication for the cloud services provided for TinyMCE.

[[privatepublic-key-pair]]
== Private/public key pair
anchor:privatepublickeypair[historical anchor]

Tokens used by the TinyMCE cloud services make use of a public/private RSA key-pair. This allows the integrating developer to have full control over the authentication as Tiny does not store the private key. Only the user has access to the private key and can produce valid tokens. Tiny only verifies that they are valid and extracts user information from that token.

The private/public key pair is created in the user's https://apps.tiny.cloud/my-account/jwt-key-manager/[Tiny account page], but only the public key is stored on Tiny web server. The user needs to store the private key in their backend.

[[jwt-provider-url]]
== JWT provider URL
anchor:jwtproviderurl[historical anchor]

The easiest way to setup JWT authentication against TinyMCE cloud services is to create a JWT provider endpoint. This endpoint takes a JSON HTTP POST request and produces a JSON result with the token that the service will then use for all the HTTP requests.

The following diagram explains the JWT call flow:

[[algorithm]]
=== Algorithm

The following algorithms are supported for the JWT header/signature:

* RS256
* RS384
* RS512
* PS256
* PS384
* PS512

All of these algorithms use the private RSA key to sign the JWT, but vary in how they execute. `RS256`, the most widely supported algorithm, features in following code examples.

[[claims]]
=== Claims:

* *sub* - _(required)_ Unique string to identify the user. This can be a database ID, hashed email address, or similar identifier.
* *name* - _(required)_ Full name of the user that will be used for presentation inside Tiny link:{baseurl}/plugins/drive.html[Drive]. When the user uploads a file, this name is presented as the creator of that file.

[[php-token-provider-example]]
== PHP token provider example
anchor:phptokenproviderexample[historical anchor]

This example uses the https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt[Firebase JWT library] provided through the Composer dependency manager. The private key should be the private key that was generated through the user's Tiny Account. Each service requires different claims to be provided. The following example shows the sub and name claims needed for Tiny Drive.

[source,php]
----
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \Firebase\JWT\JWT;

header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");

$privateKey = <<<EOD
----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----
....
----END PRIVATE KEY----
EOD;

$payload = array(
  // Unique user id string
  "sub" => "123",

// Full name of user
  "name" => "John Doe",

// Optional custom user root path
  // "https://claims.tiny.cloud/drive/root" => "/johndoe",

// 10 minutes expiration
  "exp" => time() + 60 * 10
);

try {
  $token = JWT::encode($payload, $privateKey, 'RS256');
  http_response_code(200);
  header('Content-Type: application/json');
  echo json_encode(array("token" => $token));
} catch (Exception $e) {
  http_response_code(500);
  header('Content-Type: application/json');
  echo $e->getMessage();
}
?>

[[node-token-provider-example]]
== Node token provider example
anchor:nodetokenproviderexample[historical anchor]

This example shows how to set up a Node.js express handler that produces the tokens. It requires installing the Express web framework and the `jsonwebtoken` Node modules. Each service requires different claims to be provided. The following example shows the sub and name claims needed for Tiny Drive.

[source,js]
----
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

const privateKey = `
----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----
....
----END PRIVATE KEY----
`;

app.post('/jwt', function (req, res) {
  const payload = {
    // Unique user id string
    sub: '123',

....
// Full name of user
name: 'John Doe',

// Optional custom user root path
// 'https://claims.tiny.cloud/drive/root': '/johndoe',

// 10 minutes expiration
exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 10)   };
....

try {
    const token = jwt.sign(payload, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256'});
    res.set('content-type', 'application/json');
    res.status(200);
    res.send(JSON.stringify({
      token: token
    }));
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(500);
    res.send(e.message);
  }
});

app.listen(3000);

[[tiny-drive-specific-jwt-claims]]
== Tiny Drive specific JWT claims:
anchor:tinydrivespecificjwtclaims[historical anchor]

*sub* - (required) Unique string to identify the user. This can be a database id, hashed email address, or similar identifier.

*name* - (required) Full name of the user that will be used for presentation inside Tiny Drive. When a user uploads a file, the username is presented as the creator of that file.

*\https://claims.tiny.cloud/drive/root* - (optional) Full path to a tiny drive specific root for example "/johndoe".
