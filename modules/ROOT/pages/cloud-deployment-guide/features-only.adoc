:description_short: Learn how to setup TinyMCE Plugins via our Cloud.
:keywords: tinymce cloud script textarea apiKey

If you're already comfortable hosting and maintaining https://www.tinymce.com/download/[TinyMCE Community edition], or you're running a web application where you have no control over the TinyMCE instance, you're still able to load our premium TinyMCE plugins from TinyMCE Cloud. Think of this as a hybrid deployment.

Signing up for a free API key entitles you to the premium link:{baseurl}/plugins/imagetools.html[Image Tools] plugin, with a provided cloud image proxy server already configured. You can purchase our Premium Plugins at any time once your API key is set up.

== Step 1: Embed your custom script tag into your webpage
anchor:step1embedyourcustomscripttagintoyourwebpage[historical anchor]

Within your webpage, after you've specified your script tag to load the TinyMCE editor code, you'll then need to add the following new script:

[source,js]
----
<script src="https://cloud.tinymce.com/stable/plugins.min.js?apiKey=your_API_key"></script>
----

[[step-2-specify-purchased-tinymce-plugins-and-toolbar-buttons]]
== Step 2: Specify purchased TinyMCE plugins and toolbar buttons
anchor:step2specifypurchasedtinymcepluginsandtoolbarbuttons[historical anchor]

Now you just need to extend your link:{baseurl}/configure/index.html[TinyMCE configuration] to include any additional plugins (and associated toolbar/menu items) you've purchased. You will find enablement guides here:

* link:{baseurl}/plugins/powerpaste.html[Powerpaste]
* link:{baseurl}/plugins/tinymcespellchecker.html[Spell Checker]

NOTE: `spellchecker_rpc_url` is *not* required when enabling this plugin via link:{baseurl}/cloud-deployment-guide/index.html[TinyMCE Cloud]

* link:{baseurl}/plugins/imagetools.html[Image Tools (with configured image proxy)]

NOTE: We will configure the `imagetools_cors_hosts` and `imagetools_proxy` properties for you automatically.

* link:{baseurl}/plugins/a11ychecker.html[Accessibility Checker]
* link:{baseurl}/plugins/advcode.html[Advanced Code Editor]
* link:{baseurl}/plugins/mediaembed.html[Enhanced Media Embed]
* link:{baseurl}/plugins/linkchecker.html[Link Checker]

NOTE: Please note that after purchasing a plugin, it may take up to 30 minutes for the plugin to become available with your editor. You may also need to clear your browser's cache.

Here is a complete example, whereby:

* The account `API key` has the value _TEST_API_KEY_.
* The account has the link:{baseurl}/plugins/tinymcespellchecker.html[Spell Checker] plugin enable.
