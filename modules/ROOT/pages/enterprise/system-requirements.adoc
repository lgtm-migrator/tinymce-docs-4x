[[html-cleaning]]
==== HTML Cleaning
anchor:htmlcleaning[historical anchor]

On all browsers PowerPaste provides basic HTML cleaning. For browsers where HTML5 support is not available PowerPaste uses the browser DOM to import and clean HTML. This mechanism is the primary cleaning method on browsers where HTML5 clipboard APIs are not available. While the resulting content is clean HTML the direct conversion to a browser DOM can result in some loss of content structure and/or formatting information.

[[improved-html-cleaning]]
==== Improved HTML Cleaning
anchor:improvedhtmlcleaning[historical anchor]

On browsers that support HTML5 APIs PowerPaste is able to use improved HTML cleaning techniques.  Improved HTML cleaning uses HTML5 clipboard APIs to access the clipboard directly. It can perform more complex and intelligent cleaning of the HTML than the basic HTML cleaning approach.  This better preserves the original document structure and formatting (when importing formatting). Where available this approach gives the highest fidelity copy and paste possible from Microsoft Word and HTML.

[[image-import]]
==== Image Import
anchor:imageimport[historical anchor]

On browsers that support HTML5 PowerPaste is able to import images embedded in the content (e.g. from Microsoft Word) into the editor.  These images can then be uploaded via a HTTP post as required.

[[spell-checking]]
== Spell Checking
anchor:spellchecking[historical anchor]

Spell checking is supported on all the browsers supported by TinyMCE Enterprise.

[[internet-explorer-8-and-9-limitations]]
=== Internet Explorer 8 and 9 Limitations
anchor:internetexplorer8and9limitations[historical anchor]

Cross Origin Requests (CORS) are not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and 9. For spell checking to work, the ephox-spelling service must be located on the same domain as the TinyMCE client. The domain is considered to be the combination of the protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS), server name and the port as it appears in the browser's address bar.

Internet Explorer 8 will not highlight misspelt words as you type due to browser limitations. Misspelt words are highlighted after the current HTML node is changed (e.g. when the Enter key is pressed and the cursor enters a new paragraph).

[[supported-application-servers]]
=== Supported Application Servers
anchor:supportedapplicationservers[historical anchor]
