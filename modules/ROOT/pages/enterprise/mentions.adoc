:description: Mentions brings social sharing to TinyMCE.
:keywords: atmention mention

It is now possible for users to send notifications to other users using the Mentions plugin through an `@username` in the document. Using `@username` for notifications are incredibly commonplace in social software such as Twitter and Facebook along with social enterprise applications such as IBM's Connections suite.

Users can communicate every day using `@username` on social networks and can expect to be able to use them when creating content too.

There are two deployment options. One is with TinyMCE Cloud, the other is the more traditional Self-hosted route, requiring an additional link:{baseurl}/enterprise/server/index.html[server-side component] to be installed and configured.

Please note that this feature requires a backend integration with a system to handle listing of users, as well as sending the notifications. Refer to this https://www.tinymce.com/docs/plugins/mentions/#example[example code] for more information. There are two integration points: getting a user list when `+@abc...+` is typed, and on submitting the form, sending a notification to the `@username` in the document.
