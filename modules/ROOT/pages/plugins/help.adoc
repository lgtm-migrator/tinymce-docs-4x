:title_nav: Help

The help plugin adds a button and/or menu item that opens a dialog showing two tabs:

* Handy shortcuts that explains some nice-to-know keyboard shortcuts
* Plugin list that shows which plugins that have been installed, with links to the relevant documentation pages if available, and a list of available premium plugins.

In the footer of the dialog you can also see which version of TinyMCE you are using.

The help dialog can also be shown by pressing the keyboard shortcut `Alt + 0`.
