:title_nav: Legacy Output

The `legacyoutput` plugin changes TinyMCE's output, producing legacy elements such as `font`, `b`, `i`, `u`, `strike`, and use `align` attributes.

This plugin can be useful if you want to use TinyMCE in an HTML mail client or to render contents to Flash.

However, this is *not* intended for use in producing normal web content such as in a CMS. These elements should no longer be used for such purposes since they are deprecated in later XHTML and HTML5 specifications.

*Type:* `String`
