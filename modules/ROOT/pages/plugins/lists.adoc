:title_nav: Lists

The `lists` plugin allows you to add numbered and bulleted lists to TinyMCE. To enable advanced lists (e.g. alpha numbered lists, square bullets) you should also enable the link:{baseurl}/plugins/advlist.html[Advanced List] (`advlist`) plugin.

The plugin also normalizes list behavior between browsers. Enable it if you have problems with consistency making lists.
