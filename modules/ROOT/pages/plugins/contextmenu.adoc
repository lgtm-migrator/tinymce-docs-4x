:title_nav: Context Menu

This plugin adds a configurable context menu that appears when a user right clicks in the editable area.

Note that by default `contextmenu` does not disable the operating system's native context menu.

*Type:* `String`

[[example]]
===== Example

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: "contextmenu",
  contextmenu: "link image inserttable | cell row column deletetable"
});
----

[[options]]
=== Options

These settings affect the execution of the `contextmenu` plugin. The settings in this section allow direct control over how the `contextmenu` appears and what is included inside the `contextmenu`.

[[contextmenu]]
=== `contextmenu`

This option allows you to specify which items should appear on TinyMCE's context menu.

To specify the menu items that should appear on TinyMCE's context menu, the `contextmenu` option should be provided with a space separated list of menu items. To create groups within this listing, add `"|"` pipe characters between the groups of menu items that you would like to create.

By default if you load the `contextmenu` plugin several TinyMCE plugins will automatically add items to the context menu.  For example, the `link`, `image`, and `table` plugins will all add items to the context menu if this plugin is loaded.  If you choose to define the `contextmenu` configuration item yourself (as done in the example below) you need to define *all* the elements you wish to appear on the menu.  Defining this option in the configuration effectively replaces any default settings with the list you define in the configuration.

*Type:* `String`

===== Example

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your html
  plugins: "contextmenu",
  contextmenu: "link image inserttable | cell row column deletetable"
});
----

[[contextmenu_never_use_native]]
=== `contextmenu_never_use_native`

This option allows you to disable the browser's native context menu from appearing within the editor.

We advise you give some thought about whether you really want to do this. Many users expect certain behavior when right clicking in text areas and changes may be unwelcome. But hey, you're the boss.

*Type:* `Boolean`

*Default Value:* `false`

===== Example

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: "contextmenu",
  contextmenu_never_use_native: true
});
